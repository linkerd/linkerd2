# Linkerd Community Code of Conduct

As a CNCF project, we follow the [CNCF Contributor Code of
Conduct](https://github.com/cncf/foundation/blob/master/code-of-conduct.md).
Additionally, we are committed to the following guidelines adapted from the
[Rust Code of Conduct](https://www.rust-lang.org/en-US/conduct.html):

## Community Guidelines

Our goal is to foster an inclusive and diverse community of technology
enthusiasts.

Try to be your best self. Treat your fellow community members with kindness and
empathy. We welcome disagreements when they are conducted respectfully and
without personal attacks.

We ask that you keep unstructured critique to a minimum. Disparaging remarks
about the project are unnecessary and a drain on community morale. Feedback
should be constructive and relevant. Having passionately held opinions on what
should improve is encouraged! We hope you will use that enthusiasm to roll up
your sleeves and get involved by submitting pull requests. We have additional
guidelines on [how to ask constructive
questions](https://github.com/linkerd/linkerd/wiki/How-To-Ask-Questions-in-Slack).

We don't tolerate insults, spamming, trolling, flaming, baiting, or harassment.
We don't tolerate sexual language, imagery, or unwanted advances. Private
harassment is also unacceptable.

We do our best to avoid
[subtle-isms](https://www.recurse.com/manual#sub-sec-social-rules): small
actions that make others feel uncomfortable. If you witness a subtle-ism, you
may respectfully point it out to the person publicly or privately, or you may
ask a moderator to say something. Accidentally saying something biased is
common, expected, and readily forgiven. It is not in and of itself a bannable
offense.

## Moderation

If you feel that a channel needs moderation, please message one of the
[`maintainers`](MAINTAINERS.md) directly.

Moderators will issue a warning to users who don't follow the code of conduct. A
second offense results in a temporary ban, a third warrants a permanent ban.
It's at the moderator's discretion to un-ban a remorseful user, or immediately
ban a toxic user without warning. Unjustified bans can be appealed by contacting
banhammer@buoyant.io.

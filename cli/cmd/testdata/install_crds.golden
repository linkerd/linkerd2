                  hostname for the HTTPRoute to be attached to the Listener. For example:
                  \n * A Listener with `test.example.com` as the hostname matches

                        or hostname. If 1 of 2 Gateway listeners accept attachment
                        from the referencing Route, the Route MUST be considered successfully

                        Route, the Route MUST be considered detached from the Gateway.

                        is satisfied. \n For example, take the following matches configuration:
                        \n ``` matches: - path:     value: \"/foo\"   headers:   -
                        name: \"version\"     value: \"v2\" - path:     value: \"/v2/foo\"

                        how to specify multiple match conditions that should be ANDed
                        together. \n If no matches are specified, the default is a
                        prefix path match on \"/\", which has the effect of matching

                        * Query param matches. \n If ties still exist across multiple
                        Routes, matching precedence MUST be determined in order of
                        the following criteria, continuing on ties: \n * The oldest

                        rule meeting the above criteria. \n When no rules matching
                        a request have been successfully attached to the parent a

                description: "Hostnames defines a set of hostname that should match
                  against the HTTP Host header to select a HTTPRoute to process the
                  request. This matches the RFC 1123 definition of a hostname with
                  2 notable exceptions: \n 1. IPs are not allowed. 2. A hostname may
                  be prefixed with a wildcard label (`*.`). The wildcard    label
                  must appear by itself as the first label. \n If a hostname is specified
                  by both the Listener and HTTPRoute, there must be at least one intersecting
                  hostname for the HTTPRoute to be attached to the Listener. For example:
                  \n * A Listener with `test.example.com` as the hostname matches
                  HTTPRoutes   that have either not specified any hostnames, or have
                  specified at   least one of `test.example.com` or `*.example.com`.
                  * A Listener with `*.example.com` as the hostname matches HTTPRoutes
                  \  that have either not specified any hostnames or have specified
                  at least   one hostname that matches the Listener hostname. For
                  example,   `*.example.com`, `test.example.com`, and `foo.test.example.com`
                  would   all match. On the other hand, `example.com` and `test.example.net`
                  would   not match. \n Hostnames that are prefixed with a wildcard
                  label (`*.`) are interpreted as a suffix match. That means that
                  a match for `*.example.com` would match both `test.example.com`,
                  and `foo.test.example.com`, but not `example.com`. \n If both the
                  Listener and HTTPRoute have specified hostnames, any HTTPRoute hostnames
                  that do not match the Listener hostname MUST be ignored. For example,
                  if a Listener specified `*.example.com`, and the HTTPRoute specified
                  `test.example.com` and `test.example.net`, `test.example.net` must
                  not be considered for a match. \n If both the Listener and HTTPRoute
                  have specified hostnames, and none match with the criteria above,
                  then the HTTPRoute is not accepted. The implementation must raise
                  an 'Accepted' Condition with a status of `False` in the corresponding

                                    be considered for inclusion in extended or core
                                    conformance levels. Filter-specific configuration

                                    to define custom implementation types to extend
                                    the core API with implementation-specific behavior.

                                    be resolved, the filter MUST NOT be skipped. Instead,
                                    requests that would have been processed by that
                                    filter MUST receive a HTTP error response. \n

                                      ReplacePrefixMatch of \"/xyz\" would be
                                      modified to \"/xyz/bar\". \n Note that
                                      this matches the behavior of the PathPrefix
                                      match type. This matches full path elements.
                                      A path element refers to the list of labels
                                      in the path split by the `/` separator.
                                      When specified, a trailing `/` is ignored.
                                      For example, the paths `/abc`, `/abc/`,
                                      and `/abc/def` would all match the prefix
                                      `/abc`, but the path `/abcd` would not.

                                    vendors. In the future, filters showing convergence

                        extended filters. - Implementation-specific custom filters

                        may not be combined. If an implementation can not support
                        other combinations of filters, they must clearly document
                        that limitation. In all cases where incompatible or unsupported

                        on how many BackendRefs are specified and how many are invalid.
                        \n If *all* entries in BackendRefs are invalid, and there
                        are also no filters specified in this route rule, *all* traffic
                        which matches this rule MUST receive a 500 status code. \n
                        See the HTTPBackendRef definition for the rules about what
                        makes a single HTTPBackendRef invalid. \n When a HTTPBackendRef
                        is invalid, 500 status codes MUST be returned for requests
                        that would have otherwise been routed to an invalid backend.
                        If multiple backends are specified, and some are invalid,
                        the proportion of requests that would otherwise have been
                        routed to an invalid backend MUST receive a 500 status code.
                        \n For example, if two backends are specified with equal weights,
                        and one is invalid, 50 percent of traffic must receive a 500.
                        Implementations may choose how that 50 percent is determined.

                        type of filter: \n - ALL core filters MUST be supported by
                        all implementations. - Implementers are encouraged to support
                        extended filters. - Implementation-specific custom filters
                        have no API guarantees across   implementations. \n Specifying
                        a core filter multiple times has unspecified or custom conformance.
                        \n All filters are expected to be compatible with each other
                        except for the URLRewrite and RequestRedirect filters, which
                        may not be combined. If an implementation can not support
                        other combinations of filters, they must clearly document
                        that limitation. In all cases where incompatible or unsupported
                        filters are specified, implementations MUST add a warning
                        condition to status. \n Support: Core"

                            Route). It's not recommended to set `Port` unless the

                            a specific port as opposed to a listener(s) whose port(s)
                            may be changed. When both Port and SectionName are specified,
                            the name and port of the selected listener must match
                            both specified values. \n Implementations MAY choose to
                            support other parent resources. Implementations supporting
                            other types of parent resources MUST clearly document

                            by Route kind, namespace, or hostname. If 1 of 2 Gateway
                            listeners accept attachment from the referencing Route,
                            the Route MUST be considered successfully attached. If

                description: "Hostnames defines a set of hostname that should match
                  against the HTTP Host header to select a HTTPRoute used to process
                  the request. Implementations MUST ignore any port value specified
                  in the HTTP Host header while performing a match. \n Valid values
                  for Hostnames are determined by RFC 1123 definition of a hostname
                  with 2 notable exceptions: \n 1. IPs are not allowed. 2. A hostname
                  may be prefixed with a wildcard label (`*.`). The wildcard label
                  must appear by itself as the first label. \n If a hostname is specified
                  by both the Listener and HTTPRoute, there must be at least one intersecting
                  hostname for the HTTPRoute to be attached to the Listener. For example:
                  \n * A Listener with `test.example.com` as the hostname matches
                  HTTPRoutes that have either not specified any hostnames, or have
                  specified at least one of `test.example.com` or `*.example.com`.
                  * A Listener with `*.example.com` as the hostname matches HTTPRoutes
                  that have either not specified any hostnames or have specified at
                  least one hostname that matches the Listener hostname. For example,
                  `*.example.com`, `test.example.com`, and `foo.test.example.com`
                  would all match. On the other hand, `example.com` and `test.example.net`
                  would not match. \n Hostnames that are prefixed with a wildcard
                  label (`*.`) are interpreted as a suffix match. That means that
                  a match for `*.example.com` would match both `test.example.com`,
                  and `foo.test.example.com`, but not `example.com`. \n If both the
                  Listener and HTTPRoute have specified hostnames, any HTTPRoute hostnames
                  that do not match the Listener hostname MUST be ignored. For example,
                  if a Listener specified `*.example.com`, and the HTTPRoute specified
                  `test.example.com` and `test.example.net`, `test.example.net` must
                  not be considered for a match. \n If both the Listener and HTTPRoute
                  have specified hostnames, and none match with the criteria above,
                  then the HTTPRoute is not accepted. The implementation must raise
                  an 'Accepted' Condition with a status of `False` in the corresponding
                  RouteParentStatus. \n In the event that multiple HTTPRoutes specify
                  intersecting hostnames (e.g. overlapping wildcard matching and exact
                  matching hostnames), precedence must be given to rules from the
                  HTTPRoute with the largest number of: \n * Characters in a matching
                  non-wildcard hostname. * Characters in a matching hostname. \n If
                  ties exist across multiple Routes, the matching precedence rules
                  for HTTPRouteMatches takes over. \n Support: Core"

                        resource. \n When the parent resource is a Gateway, this targets
                        all listeners listening on the specified port that also support
                        this kind of Route(and select this Route). It's not recommended
                        to set `Port` unless the networking behaviors specified in
                        a Route must apply to a specific port as opposed to a listener(s)
                        whose port(s) may be changed. When both Port and SectionName
                        are specified, the name and port of the selected listener
                        must match both specified values. \n Implementations MAY choose
                        to support other parent resources. Implementations supporting
                        other types of parent resources MUST clearly document how/if
                        Port is interpreted. \n For the purpose of status, an attachment
                        is considered successful as long as the parent resource accepts
                        it partially. For example, Gateway listeners can restrict
                        which Routes can attach to them by Route kind, namespace,
                        or hostname. If 1 of 2 Gateway listeners accept attachment
                        from the referencing Route, the Route MUST be considered successfully
                        attached. If no Gateway listeners accept attachment from this
                        Route, the Route MUST be considered detached from the Gateway.

                                    defined by \"Support: Core\" in this package,
                                    e.g. \"RequestHeaderModifier\". All implementations
                                    must support core filters. \n - Extended: Filter
                                    types and their corresponding configuration defined
                                    by \"Support: Extended\" in this package, e.g.
                                    \"RequestMirror\". Implementers are encouraged
                                    to support extended filters. \n - Implementation-specific:
                                    Filters that are defined and supported by specific
                                    vendors. In the future, filters showing convergence
                                    in behavior across multiple implementations will
                                    be considered for inclusion in extended or core
                                    conformance levels. Filter-specific configuration
                                    for such filters is specified using the ExtensionRef
                                    field. `Type` should be set to \"ExtensionRef\"
                                    for custom filters. \n Implementers are encouraged
                                    to define custom implementation types to extend
                                    the core API with implementation-specific behavior.
                                    \n If a reference to a custom filter type cannot
                                    be resolved, the filter MUST NOT be skipped. Instead,
                                    requests that would have been processed by that
                                    filter MUST receive a HTTP error response. \n

                        \n ``` matches: - path: value: \"/foo\" headers: - name: \"version\"
                        value: \"v2\" - path: value: \"/v2/foo\" ``` \n For a request

                        Note: The precedence of RegularExpression path matches are
                        implementation-specific. \n If ties still exist across multiple
                        Routes, matching precedence MUST be determined in order of
                        the following criteria, continuing on ties: \n * The oldest

                        in alphabetical order by \"{namespace}/{name}\". \n If ties
                        still exist within an HTTPRoute, matching precedence MUST
                        be granted to the FIRST matching rule (in list order) with
                        a match meeting the above criteria. \n When no rules matching
                        a request have been successfully attached to the parent a

                  with 2 notable exceptions: \n 1. IPs are not allowed. 2. A hostname
                  may be prefixed with a wildcard label (`*.`). The wildcard label
                  must appear by itself as the first label. \n If a hostname is specified
                  by both the Listener and HTTPRoute, there must be at least one intersecting
                  hostname for the HTTPRoute to be attached to the Listener. For example:

                  HTTPRoutes that have either not specified any hostnames, or have

                  * A Listener with `*.example.com` as the hostname matches HTTPRoutes
                  that have either not specified any hostnames or have specified at
                  least one hostname that matches the Listener hostname. For example,

                  would all match. On the other hand, `example.com` and `test.example.net`
                  would not match. \n Hostnames that are prefixed with a wildcard
                  label (`*.`) are interpreted as a suffix match. That means that
                  a match for `*.example.com` would match both `test.example.com`,
                  and `foo.test.example.com`, but not `example.com`. \n If both the
                  Listener and HTTPRoute have specified hostnames, any HTTPRoute hostnames
                  that do not match the Listener hostname MUST be ignored. For example,
                  if a Listener specified `*.example.com`, and the HTTPRoute specified
                  `test.example.com` and `test.example.net`, `test.example.net` must
                  not be considered for a match. \n If both the Listener and HTTPRoute

                  then the HTTPRoute is not accepted. The implementation must raise
                  an 'Accepted' Condition with a status of `False` in the corresponding
                  RouteParentStatus. \n In the event that multiple HTTPRoutes specify
                  intersecting hostnames (e.g. overlapping wildcard matching and exact
                  matching hostnames), precedence must be given to rules from the

                                    classified into three conformance levels: \n -
                                    Core: Filter types and their corresponding configuration
                                    defined by \"Support: Core\" in this package,
                                    e.g. \"RequestHeaderModifier\". All implementations
                                    must support core filters. \n - Extended: Filter
                                    types and their corresponding configuration defined
                                    by \"Support: Extended\" in this package, e.g.
                                    \"RequestMirror\". Implementers are encouraged
                                    to support extended filters. \n - Implementation-specific:
                                    Filters that are defined and supported by specific
                                    vendors. In the future, filters showing convergence
                                    in behavior across multiple implementations will
                                    be considered for inclusion in extended or core
                                    conformance levels. Filter-specific configuration
                                    for such filters is specified using the ExtensionRef
                                    field. `Type` should be set to \"ExtensionRef\"
                                    for custom filters. \n Implementers are encouraged
                                    to define custom implementation types to extend
                                    the core API with implementation-specific behavior.
                                    \n If a reference to a custom filter type cannot
                                    be resolved, the filter MUST NOT be skipped. Instead,
                                    requests that would have been processed by that
                                    filter MUST receive a HTTP error response. \n

                        is satisfied. \n For example, take the following matches configuration:
                        \n ``` matches: - path: value: \"/foo\" headers: - name: \"version\"
                        value: \"v2\" - path: value: \"/v2/foo\" ``` \n For a request

                        Note: The precedence of RegularExpression path matches are
                        implementation-specific. \n If ties still exist across multiple
                        Routes, matching precedence MUST be determined in order of
                        the following criteria, continuing on ties: \n * The oldest

                        in alphabetical order by \"{namespace}/{name}\". \n If ties
                        still exist within an HTTPRoute, matching precedence MUST
                        be granted to the FIRST matching rule (in list order) with
                        a match meeting the above criteria. \n When no rules matching

                            by Route kind, namespace, or hostname. If 1 of 2 Gateway
                            listeners accept attachment from the referencing Route,
                            the Route MUST be considered successfully attached. If

                  This matches the RFC 1123 definition of a hostname with 2 notable
                  exceptions: \n 1. IPs are not allowed. 2. A hostname may be prefixed
                  with a wildcard label (`*.`). The wildcard label MUST appear by
                  itself as the first label. \n If a hostname is specified by both
                  the Listener and GRPCRoute, there MUST be at least one intersecting
                  hostname for the GRPCRoute to be attached to the Listener. For example:
                  \n * A Listener with `test.example.com` as the hostname matches
                  GRPCRoutes that have either not specified any hostnames, or have

                  other hand, `example.com` and `test.example.net` would not match.
                  \n Hostnames that are prefixed with a wildcard label (`*.`) are

                  specified hostnames, any GRPCRoute hostnames that do not match the
                  Listener hostname MUST be ignored. For example, if a Listener specified
                  `*.example.com`, and the GRPCRoute specified `test.example.com`
                  and `test.example.net`, `test.example.net` MUST NOT be considered
                  for a match. \n If both the Listener and GRPCRoute have specified
                  hostnames, and none match with the criteria above, then the GRPCRoute

                        to support other parent resources. Implementations supporting
                        other types of parent resources MUST clearly document how/if

                        is considered successful as long as the parent resource accepts
                        it partially. For example, Gateway listeners can restrict
                        which Routes can attach to them by Route kind, namespace,
                        or hostname. If 1 of 2 Gateway listeners accept attachment
                        from the referencing Route, the Route MUST be considered successfully
                        attached. If no Gateway listeners accept attachment from this
                        Route, the Route MUST be considered detached from the Gateway.

                              inclusion in extended or core conformance levels. Filter-specific
                              configuration for such filters is specified using the
                              ExtensionRef field. `Type` MUST be set to \"ExtensionRef\"
                              for custom filters. \n Implementers are encouraged to
                              define custom implementation types to extend the core
                              API with implementation-specific behavior. \n If a reference
                              to a custom filter type cannot be resolved, the filter
                              MUST NOT be skipped. Instead, requests that would have
                              been processed by that filter MUST receive a HTTP error
                              response. \n "

                            a specific port as opposed to a listener(s) whose port(s)
                            may be changed. When both Port and SectionName are specified,

                            by Route kind, namespace, or hostname. If 1 of 2 Gateway

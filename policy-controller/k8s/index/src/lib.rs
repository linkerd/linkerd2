//! The policy controller serves discovery requests from inbound proxies, indicating how the proxy
//! should admit connections into a Pod. It watches the following cluster resources:
//!
//! - A `Namespace` may be annotated with a default-allow policy that applies to all pods in the
//!   namespace (unless they are annotated with a default policy).
//! - Each `Pod` enumerate its ports. We maintain an index of each pod's ports, linked to `Server`
//!   objects.
//! - Each `Server` selects over pods in the same namespace.
//! - Each `ServerAuthorization` selects over `Server` instances in the same namespace.  When a
//!   `ServerAuthorization` is updated, we find all of the `Server` instances it selects and update
//!   their authorizations and publishes these updates on the server's broadcast channel.
//!
//! ```text
//! [ Pod ] -> [ Port ] <- [ Server ] <- [ ServerAuthorization ]
//! ```
//!
//! Lookups against this index are initiated for a single pod & port.
//!
//! The Pod, Server, and ServerAuthorization indices are all scoped within a namespace index, as
//! these resources cannot reference resources in other namespaces. This scoping helps to narrow the
//! search space when processing updates and linking resources.

Introduce Pull Request Template

GitHub's community guidelines recommend a pull request template, the repo was
lacking one.

Introduce a `PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md` file.

Once merged, the
[Community profile checklist](https://github.com/linkerd/linkerd2/community)
should indicate the repo now provides a pull request template.

Fixes #3321

# linkerd-multicluster-link

A helm chart containing the resources to enable mirroring
of services from a remote cluster.

Warning: The purpose of this chart is just to support the `linkerd
multicluster link` CLI command, which also produces the
`cluster-credentials` secret and the Link CR, which are not found in this
chart. Therefore this chart is not a replacement for that command, and
shouldn't be used as-is unless you really know what you're doing ;-)

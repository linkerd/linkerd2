# linkerd-multicluster-link

A helm chart containing the resources to enable mirroring
of services from a remote cluster.

Warning: The purpose of this chart is just to support the `linkerd
multicluster link` CLI command, which also produces the
`cluster-credentials` secret and the Link CR, which are not found in this
chart. Therefore this chart is not a replacement for that command, and
shouldn't be used as-is unless you really know what you're doing ;-)

| enableHeadlessServices | bool | `false` | Toggle support for mirroring headless services |
| enableNamespaceCreation | bool | `false` | Toggle support for creating namespaces for mirror services when necessary |
| enablePSP | bool | `false` | Create RoleBindings to associate ServiceAccount of target cluster Service Mirror to the control plane PSP resource. This requires that `enabledPSP` is set to true on the extension and control plane install. Note PSP has been deprecated since k8s v1.21 |

| podLabels | object | `{}` | Additional labels to add to all pods |
| replicas | int | `1` | Number of service mirror replicas to run |
| resources | object | `{}` | Resources for the Service mirror container |
| revisionHistoryLimit | int | `10` | Specifies the number of old ReplicaSets to retain to allow rollback. |
| serviceMirrorGID | int | `2103` | Group id under which the Service Mirror shall be ran |
| serviceMirrorRetryLimit | int | `3` | Number of times update from the remote cluster is allowed to be requeued (retried) |
| serviceMirrorUID | int | `2103` | User id under which the Service Mirror shall be ran |
| targetClusterName | string | `""` | Name of the target cluster that's going to be linked |
| tolerations | object | `{}` | Tolerations for the Service mirror pod |
